            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>MAny other Petitions have beene delivered to His Majesty, to desire him to passe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. This Petition came very seasonably from Edenburgh before the delivery of the Propositions to the King, His Majesty received this and the rest, and said He would take the same into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would do what might be for a safe Peace: some His Majesty tould, that when the Propositions came Hee would speedily give a satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners of both Kingdomes having delivered the Propositions to His Majesty, Hee ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they had power to Treate, and being answered in the negative, His Majesty said that then they might have beene as well sent by an honest Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Martiall</hi> Preached a Sermon at Newcastle of Righteousnesse and Peace, after which His Majesty had some speech with him about some passages of some men in the Kingdome, in relation to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:159816:4"/>
            <p>The Scots Ministers have preached severall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Sermons before the King, to perswade Him to passe the Propositions; and have privately used all perswasions they could that Hee might be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a resolution for the passing of them, and His Majesty hath still had Answers ready for those, who have used any Arguments in private to Him, about the same: which were such as caused a feare of not passing them.</p>
            <p>There hath beene great Union and Love betwene the Commissioners both of England and Scotland, in the mannaging of the businesse they are intrusted with, about the Propositions.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Hinderson</hi> hath beene severall times with the King, and discoursed about the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and His Majesty hath read much in some Books by him preached to Him.</p>
            <p>His Majestie hath playd little at Goffe since the Commissioners came to Newcastle, nor of a few dayes before, and is of late very much given to privacie.</p>
            <p>There have beene some complaints made by some from about Kirkleathome, and other parts in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, to Lieutenant Generall <hi>David Lesly,</hi> against some unruly Souldiers; especially against those that were <hi>Vander Hurts</hi> men, which is to bee taken into consideration by the field Officers, as answer was given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montrosse</hi> is not yet gone from Scotland, nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depart untill he know what the event is about the Propositions.</p>
            <p>The English Commissioners do nothing without the consent of the Scottish Commissioners, nor they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159816:4"/> without consent of them, and no disagreement is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them in any thing in relation to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>The feares after the delivery of the Propositions (by what was observed) were dayly more and more; that the King would not passe the Propositions, yet still all possible meanes were used by all, in which his Lordship the E. of <hi>Pembrookes</hi> faithfulnesse, and prudence was great.</p>
            <p>Since our Commissioners have been at Newcastle, there hath not beene such endeavourings by Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to have recouse to the Court.</p>
            <p>His Majesty hath beene moved to send for Prince <hi>Charles</hi> to returne back from France, and to remaine in these Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after the Propositions were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the King: the Commissioners desired His Majestie to returne them answer with all speede that conveniently His Majesty could, to whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved answer from His Majestie that He knew the time limited, and that within the time that was set they should receive an Answer from him.
